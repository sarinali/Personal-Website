        TLDR: Vitre is an educational French learning VR app with a twist; you
        learn through reliving memories of someone else's life to experience the
        environment immersion and learn as if you are talking to someone in real
        life.

        I worked on: <a href="https://cohere.com/">co:here</a> chat and classify
        functions used to give the user a French level and dynamically chat with
        the user and I worked on frontend game menus and music. This hackathon
        was exhausting; we did not sleep the second night and worked from 9am
        all the way to 7:30am... üòÖ

        There were so many challenges I honestly lost track of times I wanted to
        cry LOL but regardless, I learned a lot about Unity 3D and developing
        for VR. I also have a newfound appreciate for game devs... I don't think
        I could do this full time.
